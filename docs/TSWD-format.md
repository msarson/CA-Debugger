# TSWD Debug Format (decoded)

Clarion's embedded debug information. Tag `TSWD` (almost certainly "TopSpeed Watcom
Debug" — Clarion's toolchain descends from TopSpeed/JPI). **Custom format, NOT
CodeView/PDB** — no off-the-shelf parser (DIA/dbghelp) will read it.

All offsets/values below decoded from
`...\HowToClarion\Browses\clbrws.exe` (Clarion 11, 32-bit, Full debug), cross-checked
against the on-disk generated sources (`..\v8Source\clbrwsNNN.clw`, resolved via the .red
redirection file). ImageBase `0x400000`.

> **Status (2026-06):** line resolution is fully decoded and verified. The primary
> address↔line path is the **`+0x1C` table** (clean, module-tagged — see below), NOT the
> Table-A/Table-B model the earlier drafts chased. Proc/module symbol names are decoded.
> Variable *types* (for watch/value support) are still open. Repro scripts:
> `spikes/tswd-*.ps1` and `spikes/tswd-*.txt`.

## Locating the blob

1. Read the PE optional header → Data Directory **index 6** (Debug Directory).
2. That points at a 28-byte `IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY` (it lives in the `.cwdebug`
   section, which is *only* those 28 bytes).
3. The entry's `Type` field = `0x44575354` = ASCII **`TSWD`** (a custom type code).
4. `SizeOfData` = size of the debug blob; `PointerToRawData` = its **file offset**.
   The blob is an **overlay appended after the last PE section**.

For this build of clbrws.exe the blob is at file offset `0x16CC00`. Always read it from the
debug directory — it is build-specific (an earlier draft recorded `0x16CA00` from a prior
build). Everything below is **blob-relative**.

## Header (TOC) — at blob+0x00, little-endian u32

| Offset | Value (this build) | Meaning |
|--------|--------------------|---------|
| +0x00 | `0x44575354` | magic `TSWD` |
| +0x04 | `0x3C` | header size (60 bytes) |
| +0x08 | `0x38` | → **module-name offset array** (u32 offsets into name pool; one per module) |
| +0x0C | `0x128` | → **module-name string pool** (null-term plaintext: `ABBROWSE.CLW`, `clbrws001.clw`, …) |
| +0x10 | `0x444` | → per-module **byte-slice** table into Table A (see "the +0x10 trap" below — NOT run boundaries) |
| +0x14 | `0x624` | → **Table A** — line-major line records (continuous 6-byte grid) |
| +0x18 | `0x889C` | → **Table B** — flat 6-byte parse is unreliable; superseded by +0x1C |
| +0x1C | `0x3282C` | → **ADDRESS→LINE table (the one to use)** — 8-byte `{rva, line, moduleIdx}` |
| +0x20 | `0x76D0C` | → **symbol-name string pool** (plaintext) |
| +0x24 | `0x3D` = 61 | module count field |
| +0x28 | `0x87AC4` | → **module backref array** (61 u32; each is a "module block" key — its index = module index) |
| +0x2C | `0x87BB8` | → table |
| +0x30 | `0x8B9` = 2233 | symbol count |
| +0x34 | `0x126E88` | → near-end table |

Module-name offset array (at +0x08): byte offsets into the pool at +0x0C. **Module index 0 =
`ABBROWSE.CLW`**, and the array is the canonical module ordering — see "the module index is
one number" below. The current build has 60 name entries; 56 of them carry code.

Symbol pool sample (at +0x20): `_main`, `clbrws$$$__attach_process`, `SELECTJOBS@F`,
`BROWSEAUTHORSEIP@F`, `R$BRW1::SELECTSORT`, `R$BRW1::INITIALIZEBROWSE`, `JOB:JOBID`,
`BRW1::LASTSORTORDER`, …

---

## ★ The +0x1C table — the primary address→line index

This is the table to build the resolver on. The earlier drafts mislabeled it
"symbol/addr record table"; it is in fact a clean, global, **address-major line table with
module tags baked in**.

```
struct AddrLineRec {           // 8 bytes, little-endian
    uint32 codeRVA;
    uint16 line;               // source line within the owning module (see caveats)
    uint16 moduleIdx;          // == module-name-array index (see below)
};
```

Verified properties (this build): **34,972 records, 100% within `.text`, strictly
RVA-ascending, ZERO resets.**

**Resolution:**
- **address → line** (resolve a breakpoint hit / current line): binary-search by `codeRVA`
  for the greatest record `≤ target`; return `{line, moduleIdx}`. No segmentation, no phase,
  no per-module bookkeeping.
- **line → address** (set a breakpoint at `file:line`): filter records by `moduleIdx`
  (for the file) then by `line`. (Table A also works but +0x1C is simpler and already tagged.)
- **moduleIdx → .clw name**: `names[moduleIdx]` — trivial (see next section).

`moduleIdx` partitions all code into 56 compilands; each module's `[min RVA, max RVA]` is its
contiguous `.text` region.

## The module index is *one* number

The `moduleIdx` in the +0x1C table **equals** the `+0x08` module-name-array index **equals**
the symbol records' `moduleBackref` index. They are the same module ordering. Therefore:

```
moduleIdx  ->  .clw name   ==   names[moduleIdx]
```

No content-matching, no heuristics. Verified end-to-end, e.g.
`SELECTJOBS@F → entryRVA 0x48D5C → moduleIdx 37 → names[37] = "clbrws011.clw"` and
`BROWSEAUTHORSEIP@F → 0x32D64 → moduleIdx 29 → names[29] = "clbrws003.clw"`.

`moduleIdx` is **not contiguous** — the no-code modules (their `+0x10` slice is `{0,0}`)
occupy their name-array index but produce no +0x1C records, so those indices are simply
absent. Don't assume `0..55`; iterate the indices that appear.

## Symbol table — proc/method/routine name → entry RVA

The symbol-name pool is at `+0x20` (plaintext). Symbol **definition** records (scattered
after the name pool; **byte-granular, not 4-aligned** to any table) are 12 bytes:

```
struct SymDefRec {             // 12 bytes, little-endian
    uint32 nameRef;            // offset into the +0x20 name pool; the name is NUL-preceded
    uint32 entryRVA;           // symbol entry (image-relative)
    uint32 moduleBackref;      // == one of the 61 values in the +0x28 array;
                               //    that value's INDEX is the module index
};
```

The `{nameRef, entryRVA}` pair also appears at **call sites**, so to select *definitions*
require the 3rd field to be a valid `+0x28` value (and skip `__thunk.*` names — a thunk lives
in the caller's module, not the definee's). That filter yields ~2233 defs (= the `+0x30`
count).

Name conventions in the pool:
- **Top-level procedures**: `NAME@F` or `NAME@F<digits>` (e.g. `SELECTJOBS@F`, `MAIN@F`).
- **Class methods**: `NAME@F<nn>CLASSNAME...` (e.g. `UPDATE@F8INICLASS`).
- **Routines**: `R$PROC::ROUTINENAME` (e.g. `R$BRW1::SELECTSORT`).
- **Thunks**: `__thunk.NAME@F` (skip for definitions).

**Semantic (proc count per module):** of the 32 modules carrying top-level proc defs, **31
have exactly one proc (1:1)** — every generated `clbrwsNNN.clw` procedure module is one proc.
One module (a runtime/error module) holds 3. Library modules (`ABBROWSE`, `RTFCTL`,
`CWUTIL`, …) carry **class methods, not top-level procs** (0 `NAME@F` defs).

**Caveat — entry vs region floor:** a proc's `entryRVA` (from its symbol) can sit *above* its
module's lowest +0x1C RVA. Clarion emits some proc code (ROUTINEs / init / embed / cold) at
lower addresses than the named entry. So use `entryRVA` as the proc's canonical "start"
address, but use **+0x1C records filtered by moduleIdx** for line↔address (authoritative for
the whole module region).

See `spikes/tswd-symbols.txt` for the full 32-row module→proc fixture and
`spikes/tswd-procsym-decode.ps1` for the decoder.

## Table A (+0x14) — line-major records (cross-check / fallback)

`[+0x14, +0x18)` is a **single continuous 6-byte grid** (no per-module realignment):

```
struct LineRec { uint16 line; uint32 codeRVA; };   // 6 bytes
```

Read it straight from `+0x14`; do **not** phase-detect per `+0x10` chunk (the "0–5 byte
phase per module" model in earlier drafts was an artifact of measuring from arbitrary chunk
starts — a chunk's apparent phase is just `(chunkStart − OffTableA) mod 6`).

The grid is a sequence of **per-compiland line-major runs** delimited by **line resets**
(line drops back to the file's first code line). Within a run the records ascend by line; the
RVAs scatter (line-major). Line numbers run **cumulatively** across a compiland group, so a
run's max line can exceed any single `.clw`'s length (the tail is compiler/include-internal).

Because +0x1C gives the same line data already address-sorted and module-tagged, Table A is
now only a **cross-check / fallback**. If you parse it, segment by resets, not by +0x10.

### The +0x10 trap (why earlier resolvers drifted)

`+0x10` (`[0x444, 0x624)`, 2× u32 per module = `{ uint32 sliceStart; uint32 sliceEnd; }`,
absolute blob offsets into Table A, `{0,0}` for no-code modules) was read as if each slice
were one module's records. **It is not.** The byte slices tile Table A contiguously but their
boundaries fall *mid-run*: a single compiland's run is chopped across several slices, and one
slice can hold the tail of one run plus the head of the next. Treating slices as module
record boundaries causes the classic symptoms (wrong line labels at slice edges, truncated
modules, line numbers attributed to the wrong file). Use +0x1C's `moduleIdx` instead; if you
must use Table A, segment by line resets and attach names via `names[moduleIdx]`.

## Table B (+0x18) — not needed

`[+0x18, +0x1C)` parses *flat* as 6-byte `{u32 rva, u16 line}` but that parse is unreliable
(its start decodes to out-of-`.text` RVAs), and it is **not required** — +0x1C is the clean
global address→line index. Leave Table B unparsed unless a future need appears.

---

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **Template-similarity trap.** Clarion browse/form procedures are generated from shared
  templates, so different `.clw` files are *line-for-line identical* over long stretches
  (e.g. `BRW1::SelectSort` at the same line in many browses). Content-matching a `(line →
  source text)` pair against candidate `.clw` files therefore mis-binds, and so does
  comparing line numbers across files. **Bind module identity by `moduleIdx` (= name index),
  never by source-line content.** This bit twice during decode; the symbol/+0x1C indices are
  the template-proof source of truth.
- **Cumulative line tail.** A module's records can carry `line` values beyond the `.clw`'s
  physical length (cumulative numbering). Gate user breakpoints to `line ≤ fileLen`; treat
  larger values as compiler/include-internal.
- **moduleIdx gaps.** No-code modules have no records; their indices are absent. Don't assume
  a contiguous range.
- **entryRVA ≥ region floor is false.** See the symbol-table caveat above.

## Ground-truth confirmation

Source verified against `..\v8Source\` (regenerated before compile, so on-disk == compiled):

```
clbrws011.clw : SelectJobs, line 317 = "BRW1::LastSortOrder = BRW1::SortOrder"
clbrws003.clw : BrowseAuthorsEIP (line 317 = "DO RefreshWindow" — different proc, same line!)
```

Regression anchors for the resolver (template-proof; key on address → moduleIdx → name):

```
resolve(addr 0x48D5C) -> { moduleIdx 37, clbrws011.clw, proc SELECTJOBS }
resolve(addr 0x32D64) -> { moduleIdx 29, clbrws003.clw, proc BROWSEAUTHORSEIP }
names[37] == "clbrws011.clw" ;  names[29] == "clbrws003.clw"
```

> Do **not** assert `line 317 → 0x31F68 == clbrws011` — `0x31F68` is `clbrws003`'s line 317
> (the template-similarity trap). Resolve via address → moduleIdx → `names[]`.

## Implementation notes (ClarionDbg.Core)

- Parse `+0x1C` as `List<AddrLineRec>{ rva, line, moduleIdx }`; build a `moduleIdx →
  { entryRVA = min rva, hiRVA = max rva, recordCount }` map and a sorted-by-rva index.
- `address → line`: binary search the rva index. `line → address`: filter by `moduleIdx`.
- `moduleIdx → .clw`: `names[moduleIdx]` (module-name array, +0x08).
- The old flat `TswdDebugInfo.TryAddrToLine` / `RvasForLine` / `BuildModules`
  (Table-A-by-+0x10) are superseded — replace with the +0x1C path. `OffTableAfterB`
  (`U32(0x1C)`) is the +0x1C base; the previous `ByAddr` parse read the wrong region/width.

## The +0x2C region — the typed symbol/scope tree (Phase 3 decode, 2026-06-09)

The bulk of the blob (`[+0x2C, +0x34)` ≈ 654 KB here) is a **typed symbol tree**: data
symbols (globals, file record buffers + fields, stack locals, class properties) with
offsets/addresses, type codes, sizes, and parent/child structure. Decoded from spike probes
(`spikes/tswd-datasym*.ps1`); grammar understood structurally, full walker still to write.

### Record grammar (as far as proven)

Symbol records open with a **tag byte**, then a `u32 link`, then the payload. The two
families probed end-to-end:

```
tag 0x04  — top-level symbol definition (proc OR static data):
    04 | u32 link | u32 nameRef | u32 rva | u32 moduleBackref | <type info...>
tag 0x0C  — member/child symbol (record field, class property, local):
    0C | u32 link | u32 nameRef | i32 offset | u32 parentRef | <type info...>
```

- **The item-1 "12-byte def record" is the middle of a tag-04 record.** The
  `{nameRef, entryRVA, moduleBackref}` triple the proc scan matches is preceded by
  `04 <link>` — that is why def records appeared "byte-granular and scattered": they are
  embedded in this stream. One grammar covers procs AND static data.
- `link` values ascend with the stream (≈ self/next-record offsets relative to a base near
  `tbl2C − 0x12`; exact base convention still to pin down — derive it from the walker, not
  from constants).
- **`offset` meaning depends on the family**: tag-04 statics carry an absolute **RVA**
  (e.g. `JOBS$JOB:RECORD → 0xCD1F4`, in `.cwtls` — threaded statics live there; plain
  globals/VMTs in `.data`); tag-0C fields carry the offset **within the parent record**
  (`JOB:JOBID → 0`, first field of `JOB:RECORD`); tag-0C stack locals carry a **negative
  EBP-relative frame offset** (`BRW1::LASTSORTORDER → -163` in one browse).
- `parentRef` of a tag-0C record points at the owning symbol's record (same link-space);
  tag-04 records carry the `+0x28` module backref instead (same module binding as procs).

#### Child-pointer convention — SOLVED (2026-06, cross-validated on another Clarion 11 build)

The piece left open above ("exact base convention still to pin down") is decoded. A GROUP/
RECORD's type info is `00 08 <u32 size> <u32 count> <u32 childptr × count>`, and each child
field record is located at:

```
child_abs = tbl2C + childptr        (childptrs listed in declaration order)
```

i.e. the base is **`tbl2C` itself**, which is `linkBase + 0x12` (the doc already notes
`linkBase ≈ tbl2C − 0x12`). That offset of `0x12` is why the `linkBase ± 2` candidates in
`spikes/tswd-datasym6.ps1` never resolved — the children sit `0x12` further on.

Confirmed: **tag-0C `linkBase` = tag-04 `linkBase` + 1** — consistent with this doc's own
anchors (`JOBS$JOB:RECORD` tag-04 → `0x87D72`; `JOB:JOBID` tag-0C → `0x87D73` in
`datasym5`). A tag-0C field's **byte size** can be derived from the **offset gap** to the
next field (sorted by offset; last field runs to the group size) — no need to decode the
string-size sub-record. Field **type** is the type-info code byte (`0x11` signed int,
`0x12` unsigned/BYTE, `0x18` STRING, `0x16` `&`-ref, `0x13` REAL, `0x08` nested GROUP, …).

Validated on a different Clarion 11 binary (`TestDashboard.exe`), e.g. the global
`COLORMAP` (54 bytes) → `COLOR` LONG @0, `TEXT` STRING(25) @4, `TEXTKEY` STRING(25) @29;
file-record buffers (`*$RECORD`) decode their fields likewise. The clbrws anchor to
cross-check is `JOBS$JOB:RECORD` (4 children covering 0x37 bytes): its childptrs resolve
via `tbl2C + childptr`.

*(Found while building [clarion-pdb](https://github.com/msarson/clarion-pdb), a Clarion
TSWD→Microsoft PDB generator that consumes the same format; this back-feeds the watch/value
walker tracked in "Open items".)*

### Type info (observed, enum not yet complete)

After the location fields comes type information, e.g.:

```
JOBS$JOB:RECORD : 00 08 <u32 size=0x37> 04 00 00 00 <u32 child-ptr ×4>   (GROUP/RECORD,
                  55 bytes, 4 child field records — the JOB: fields)
JOB:JOBID       : 11 <u32 size=2>                                        (SHORT?)
BRW1::LASTSORTORDER : 04 12 <u32 size=1>                                 (BYTE?)
```

Working hypotheses: `0x08` = GROUP/RECORD (carries child list), `0x11` = SHORT, `0x12` =
BYTE; sizes match the Clarion declarations. The full type-code enum (STRING/CSTRING/
PSTRING/LONG/DECIMAL/REAL/QUEUE/...) needs systematic validation against the clbrws
dictionary — record strides of 10/22/23/12/13 bytes in different areas say several record
shapes exist (class properties around blob+0x880xx, per-proc locals blocks, etc.).

### Scan findings (clbrws.exe, this build)

- The `.text`-filtered def scan finds 2057 records; allowing all sections finds +159 in
  `.data`/`.cwtls` (VMT$ vtables, library statics like `DEFAULTERRORS`, `ZOOMPRESETS`) —
  consistent with the TOC `+0x30` count (2236).
- App-level data names (`JOB:JOBID`, `BRW1::LASTSORTORDER`, `SAVEPATH`,
  `BRW1::AUTO::SAVE:JOB:JOBID`, …) appear ONLY inside the +0x2C tree, not as 12-byte
  top-level defs. `BRW1::LASTSORTORDER` appears 26× — once per browse procedure's locals
  block (each browse has its own local instance).

### Watch-by-name resolution chains (the goal)

```
global static : name → tag-04 record → RVA (+ loadBase) → address; type+size render it
file field    : FILE$REC:RECORD tag-04 → record base RVA; field tag-0C → +offset
stack local   : proc scope → tag-0C frame offset → EBP + offset (needs paused thread ctx)
```

## Open items (Phase 3 — watch/value support)

- **Walker**: parse the +0x2C stream systematically (record framing per tag byte, link
  base convention, scope tree), instead of name-ref probing. *(Child-base convention is
  now solved — see "Child-pointer convention" above: `child_abs = tbl2C + childptr`.)*
- **Clarion type-code enumeration** — validate codes against the clbrws dictionary; map →
  STRING / CSTRING / PSTRING / BYTE / SHORT / LONG / DECIMAL / REAL / GROUP / QUEUE etc.
  with picture/size. Cross-decode (clarion-pdb, calibration build): `0x11` signed int,
  `0x12` unsigned int/BYTE, `0x13` IEEE REAL, `0x14` char, `0x16` `&`-ref, `0x18` STRING/
  CSTRING/PSTRING, `0x23` DECIMAL, `0x24` PDECIMAL, `0x25` MS-binary float, `0x08` GROUP/
  QUEUE — width by the size field. (`0x11` is signed, not specifically SHORT.)
- **Threaded variables** — `.cwtls` statics are per-thread instances allocated at runtime;
  the blob RVA is the template. **Live-tested 2026-06-09 (John, clbrws Jobs browse):** the
  template VA reads as zeros while the same field shows a live value on screen — per-thread
  instances do NOT live at the template address, not even for the first/main thread.
  Non-threaded `.data` symbols DO read live at template VA (verified:
  `_CLARIONMONTHLISTLONG` → "January February …"). Resolving a thread's instance needs the
  Clarion runtime's thread-data base (TLS slot / clarun helper — the `DEBUGHOOK` route);
  follow-up spike.
