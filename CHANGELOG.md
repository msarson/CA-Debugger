All notable changes to CA Debugger are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## v1.1.0 — 2026-06-16

A large feature release focused on the debugging experience — richer breakpoints,
live value editing, faster navigation, and a more flexible layout — on top of the
same proven 32-bit engine + WebView2 front-end.

### Added

- **Advanced breakpoints** — give any breakpoint a **condition** (break only when
  an expression is true), a **hit-count rule** (break on the Nth hit, every Nth, or
  when hits ≥ N), or turn it into a **tracepoint** (log an interpolated `{var}`
  message and keep running — never pauses). Edited from the Breakpoints pane.
- **Run to cursor** — while paused, right-click a line in the debugger's Source
  panel to resume and stop there. It plants a one-shot breakpoint that removes
  itself automatically and leaves nothing behind in the Breakpoints pane.
- **Break on procedure entry** — right-click a row in the new Procedures pane to
  drop a breakpoint at that procedure's definition line.
- **Edit variable values** — type a new value into a variable's value cell (in the
  Variables tree or Watch) to write it into the live process.
- **Procedures pane** — a filterable, clickable list of every procedure/method in
  the target; click to jump to its `.clw` definition.
- **Disassembly view** — a gated x86 disassembly of the current location, with
  **instruction-level stepping** (step one instruction, into or over calls).
- **Filter & sort** — per-pane filter boxes and a name sort on the Variables and
  Call Stack panes.
- **DATE / TIME view-as** — render a Clarion `LONG` holding a Standard Date or Time
  as a formatted date/time instead of the raw number.
- **Variables tree overhaul** — call-stack-frame-scoped locals (frame-aware
  Procedure Data / Method Data), array elements, and lazy on-demand expansion of
  by-reference structures (GROUP / CLASS / QUEUE), plus module-scope data.
- **Rearrangeable layout** — a two-column workspace; drag to reorder, collapse, or
  hide sections, with your arrangement remembered.
- **Pause / break-into** a running target, and **multi-DLL** debugging —
  breakpoints, hits, and stack frames resolve correctly across DLL boundaries.
- **Debug Console** copy / clear actions.

### Changed

- Pause/step navigation is **Monaco-aware** — when the ClarionAssistant Monaco
  overlay is active, the editor scrolls to and highlights the current line.
- Call stack is walked via the **EBP chain** (with at-entry caller and
  monotonic-frame guards), replacing the older over-inclusive stack scan.

### Fixed

- **Step Over** no longer skips a line that immediately follows a procedure call.
- Breakpoint and call-stack clicks navigate reliably to the target line (including
  under the Monaco overlay).
- Removing one of several gutter lines that snapped to the same code line no longer
  leaves the shared breakpoint planted and firing (ref-counted INT3).

### Requirements

- Clarion 10, 11, or 12 (32-bit).
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime (for the debugger pad UI).
- The target application must be compiled with **Full** debug information.

### Install

Download `CA-Debugger-1.1.0-Setup.exe` from the release assets and run it (close
the Clarion IDE first). See the [User Guide](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ClarionLive/CA-Debugger/blob/main/docs/user-guide.html) for usage.

## v1.0.1 — 2026-06-10

First public release of CA Debugger — a modern, source-level debugger addin for
the Clarion IDE (Clarion 10, 11, and 12). It plugs into the IDE's existing
breakpoint/jump-to-line plumbing and supplies its own 32-bit debug engine plus a
clean WebView2 front-end.

### Highlights

- **Source-level debugging** — set breakpoints in the Clarion editor gutter,
  Start/Continue/Step Over/Step Into/Step Out/Stop, with a live current-line bar.
- **Real call stack** with procedure names and `module : line`; click a frame to
  jump to it.
- **Watch by name** — type-ahead add, ★-pin from the Variables tree, right-click
  multi-add, and hover data-tips that show value/type with pin & copy actions.
- **Variables tree** — file record buffers (Tables) and Global Variables, with
  live values resolved while visible.
- **Registers** view while paused.

### Added

- **Auto-resolve Target EXE** from the IDE's active project (reads the project's
  output type/name), so the field is usually pre-filled.
- **Settings popup with configurable debug shortcut keys.** Debug commands ship
  unbound (the IDE claims F5/F10/F11); bind your own combinations via the gear
  menu. Bindings persist locally.
- **Inno Setup installer** — picks up Clarion 10/11/12 automatically and lets you
  choose which version(s) to install into.

### Changed

- Focus returns to the debugger pad after stepping, so configured step shortcuts
  keep working in a loop.

### Fixed

- **Light theme readability.** Variable names, the primary **Start** button,
  record fields, and the **TARGET EXE** label were hardcoded to light colors that
  were unreadable on the light background. They now use theme-aware colors
  (a darker blue for identifiers, near-black for fields, off-white for the
  exebar label).

### Requirements

- Clarion 10, 11, or 12 (32-bit).
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime (for the debugger pad UI).
- The target application must be compiled with **Full** debug information.

### Install

Download `CA-Debugger-1.0.1-Setup.exe` from the release assets and run it (close
the Clarion IDE first). See the [User Guide](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ClarionLive/CA-Debugger/blob/main/docs/user-guide.html) for usage.
